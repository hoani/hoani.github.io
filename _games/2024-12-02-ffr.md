**About**

This game was made in four days as an entry to the GMC Jam 54. 

The theme of the Jam was `Revolution`.

I wanted to make a game where timing your blocks resulted in parrying your opponent and making them vulnerable to attack. You can also cancel attacks which emulates *feinting* to throw off your opponent's timing.
