My wife and I have been fans of MMA for a few years. 

In early June this year, Emma found out about a 20 week MMA bootcamp program running out of City Kickboxing. 

The training was tough. I remember early in the camp unable to continue one of the cardio rounds thinking "is this really all that I have? I hope they don't kick me out".

In the end, we both completed the camp and had our fights.
