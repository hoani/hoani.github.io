Essence Child, solve the puzzle, save your planet!

The sun, which revolves around the planet of the ancients is nearing its last days. The only way to avoid its destruction and keep the planet alive is to find the mystic liquid, celatin. Unfortunately, the celatin is locked deep within a chamber of puzzles. Only you can rescue the planet!

This game was made by Living Energy, a team I joined in a forum. The participating members were:
* Derby (aka: Kyl3)
* Dark Krim
* RadagastBrown
* JackRussel (me)
