This game was originally made in four days as an entry to the GMC Jam 53. 

The theme of the Jam was `In a simulation`.

After seeing the popularity of Throw a Watermelon on gx.games, I released a version 1.1 with several qulaity of life improvements and bug fixes.

The game is built around gamemaker's physics engine - it has a few interesting quirks; but for the most part allows for a lot of fun freedom for building things.
