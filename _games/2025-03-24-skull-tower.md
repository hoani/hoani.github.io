Humanity is finally free from Skelletrex. However, the seven bone generals are attempting to revive Skelletrex and enslave humans once again.

The world needs a warrior to put an end to the bone generals' plans.

**About**

This game was made in five days as an entry to the GMC Jam 55. 

The theme of the Jam was `Adrenaline`.

In this game I challenged myself to use a limited color pallete (https://lospec.com/palette-list/16-bital), which includes no alpha blending or anti-aliasing effects.
