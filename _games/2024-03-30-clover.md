Clover is the first game I have made in eleven years.

You play as a merchant who is defending her cart from hoards of bandits.

The game was designed to play a little bit like space invaders, but instead of shooting up, you shoot sideways.

You can either download it (on the left) or click to play below.

I hope you enjoy it!
