### Const Memory

Changing the value of a `const`:
* Storage for a `const` value may be changed by using pointers.
* Compilers may choose to just replace occurances of the const with its value.
* See [http://cpp.sh/86yky](http://cpp.sh/86yky) for an example.

```cpp
const int year = 2020;
int * time_machine;
time_machine = (int *)&year;
*time_machine = 2019;
const int *year_stored = &year;
std::cout << *year_stored << std::endl; // output: 2019
std::cout << year << std::endl; // output: 2020
```
---
### Const pointers 

Pointer to a `const` value (i.e. can't change the value)
```cpp
const int *ptr;
int const *ptr; // does the same as the line above
```

`const` pointer to a value (i.e. can't change the pointer)
```cpp
int * const ptr;
```
---
### Const with Classes 

`const` in `class` methods:
* Indicates that class member variables won't be modified in this method

```cpp
class TimeMachine {
private:
	int year;
public:
	int get_year() const {
		return year;
	}
}

// When accessing a reference of a class, we can only use the const methods
int my_age(const TimeMachine& time_machine) {
	// This is an error if get_year is not const
	return time_machine.get_year() - 1988; 
}
```
