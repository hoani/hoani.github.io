I've been working on a simple package [github.com/hoani/getset](https://github.com/hoani/getset) lately, and I wanted to make sure I had some nice documentation alongside the package.

## Installing godoc

Install the latest godoc:
```sh
go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc@latest
```

You can run godoc with:
```sh
godoc -http :8080
```

If you navigate through the index, you should be able to find you package, mine was here:

## Some godoc tips and tricks

Comment above the package name to add overview documentation:
```go
// A lightweight set implementation.
//
// Requires go 1.18 or higher.
package getset
```

Comment above public functions and types to add documentation for them. For example:
```go
// Has checks if an item is included in the set.
func (s Set[T]) Has(item T) bool {
```

### Examples

I place examples in a file called `examples_test.go` under a `<packagename>_test` package.

The following examples will show up in the overview:
```go
func Example() { // the first example
  //...
}

func Example_extra() { // will be called `Example (extra)`
  //...
}
```

If you have a function called `New`, add an example to the `New` section as follows:
```go
func ExampleNew() {
  //...
}
```

If you have a type called `MyType`, add an example for `MyType` as follows:
```go
func ExampleMyType() {
  //...
}
```

If `MyType` has a method `DoSomething`, add an example for `DoSomething` as follows:
```go
func ExampleMyType_DoSomething(){
  //...
}
```

## Update the go indexes

```sh
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org go list -m <repo>@v0.1.0
```

If your repo is public, it should appear on `https://pkg.go.dev/<repo>`
