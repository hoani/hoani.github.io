Today is a very important day. The board are visiting and Connor Holt wants everyone on their best behavior.

Too bad for Connor - you're his boss.

And you can do whatever you want!

**About**

This game was an entry to the gx.games [Viral Glitch Game Jam](https://gx.games/events/viral-glitch/). 

The theme of the Jam was `Predictably Unpredictable`.

So I decided to make a game where you build things, but aren't always sure if it will work out.
