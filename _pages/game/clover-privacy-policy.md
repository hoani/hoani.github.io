### Data Collection

No identifying user data is collected in Clover.

Data collection is limited to:
* Total number of times the game is played across all users
* Daily and all-time highscores

Both metrics are anonymous and contain no information about individual users.

The purpose of collecting these metrics is to get an understanding of how many people have played the game and how far players managed to get in the game.
