## Installation

```
go install github.com/golang/mock/gomock
go install github.com/golang/mock/mockgen
```

## Generating Mocks

The syntax is:

```sh
mockgen -destination=<file> <package> <interface>
```

Say we want to mock a `Servo` interface part of the `servo` package:

```sh
mockgen -destination=mocks/mock_servo.go servo Servo
```

If we want to lump all of our mocks into one package called `mocks`, run:

```sh
mockgen -destination=mocks/mock_servo.go -package=mocks servo Servo
```

If servo is an external package, provide the full path:
```sh
mockgen -destination=mocks/mock_servo.go github.com/hoani/robogo/servo Servo
```

## Mock Testing

### Setting up mock objects

```go
mockCtl := gomock.NewController(t)
defer mockCtl.Finish()

mockServo := mocks.NewMockServo(MockCtl)
```

### Mock EXPECT

Asserts that `MoveToAngle` is called with angle `45.0` once. Will return true.
```go
mockServo.EXPECT().MoveToAngle(45.0).
	Return(true).Times(1)
```

Asserts that `MoveToAngle` is called once, but doesn't care what angle is provided. Will return true.
```go
mockServo.EXPECT().MoveToAngle(gomock.Any()).
	Return(true).Times(1)
```

`Times(n)` can be replaced with:
* `MinTimes(n)` or `MaxTimes(n)`
* `AnyTimes()` when we don't care if/how often it gets called

Sometimes, we want to take an action when a function is called:

```go
mockServo.EXPECT().MoveToAngle(gomock.Any()).
	DoAndReturn(func(angle float32) bool {
		select {
			case <- ctx.Done():
				return false
			case angleCh <- angle:
				return true
		}	
	}).AnyTimes()
```
