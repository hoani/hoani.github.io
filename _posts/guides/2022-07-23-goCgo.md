Cgo lets us include C code in Go.

## Inline C in go

You can write C code in go files by adding it as comments above an `import "C"` statement:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

/*
#include <stdint.h>
uint8_t shift(uint8_t x, int y) {
  return x << y;
}
*/
import "C"

func main() {
  in, n := uint8(0x10), 2
  out := C.shift(C.uint8_t(in), C.int(2))
  fmt.Printf("Shifted %#x by %d, got %#x\n", in, n, out)
}
```

If we run this, we print:
```
Shifted 0x10 by 2, got 0x40
```

We can also use installed C libraries directly in go:

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "math"
)

// #include <math.h>
import "C"

func main() {
  fmt.Printf(" C π: %.9f\nGo π: %.9f\n", C.M_PI, math.Pi)
}
```

Gives us:
```
 C π: 3.141593000
Go π: 3.141592654
```

## Compiling C files

We may want to import C from source. Using the shift example from above, we can organise our go project into:
```
|-main.go
|-shift.c
|-shift.h
```

In `main.go`:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

// #include "shift.h"
import "C"

func main() {
  in, n := uint8(0x10), 2
  out := C.shift(C.uint8_t(in), C.int(2))
  fmt.Printf("Shifted %#x by %d, got %#x\n", in, n, out)
}
```

In `shift.h`:
```c
#include <stdint.h>

uint8_t shift(uint8_t x, int y);
```

In `shift.c`:
```c
#include "shift.h"

uint8_t shift(uint8_t x, int y) {
	return x << y;
}
```

And we should be able to compile and run as normal, getting the same result as before:
```
Shifted 0x10 by 2, got 0x40
```

## Calling Go in C

We may want to leverage Go to enhance the capabilities of our C libraries. Similar to the previous section, we will organize our code as follows:
```
|-main.go
|-gocaller.c
|-gocaller.h
```

In this example, we will use Go's `json` library to encode some values provided by our C code.

In our `main.go` file, we will use the `//export` directive to export a go function that our C code can use:
```go
package main

import (
  "encoding/json"
)

// #include "gocaller.h"
import "C"

//export Encode
func Encode(a C.int, b C.int, c C.int) *C.char {
  m := map[string]C.int{"a": a, "b": b, "c": c}
  bytes, _ := json.Marshal(&m)
  var result *C.char = C.CString(string(bytes))
  // Warning: `result` is a memory leak!
  return result
}

func main() {
  C.addAndEncodeWithGo(1, 2)
}
```

Inside `gocaller.h`, we have:
```c
void addAndEncodeWithGo(int a, int b);
```

And inside `gocaller.c`, we `#include "_cgo_export.h"` so that we can call our `Encode` function from Go.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "gocaller.h"

#include "_cgo_export.h"

void addAndEncodeWithGo(int a, int b) {
    char* encoded = Encode(a, b, a + b);
    printf("Encoded message `%s`\n", encoded);
}
```

If we run this, our C code calls Go's `Encode` function, and then prints the json object to the terminal:
```
Encoded message `{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3}`
```

## Notes on CGo

* There is no garbage collection for C pointers. The example for calling Go from C had a memory leak, where we assigned a `*C.char` pointer.
  * This should always be freed with `C.free`, usually using `defer` to ensure the lifetime is contained:
  ```go
    var cstr *C.char = C.CString(gostr)
    defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(cstr))
  ```
* Compiled Go code using Cgo is only useful for the machine (OS/arch) that the code is compiled on.
  * Go cross compilation in Cgo is usually not worth the effort
  * Compiling your Go code for other machines is limited by the availablity of the C libraries you need.
* Compared to pure Go, Cgo has very little native debugging support
