Can you believe it... Skeletrex is back, and he's on the moon! 

There are only enough resources to build a single pillar to the moon and defeat Skeletrex, it's all or nothing!

**About**

This game was made in about one day as an entry to the GMC Jam 56. 

The theme of the Jam was `All or Nothing`.

Having limited time, I wanted to get experimental with this one.
